#     PROBLEM:
#     Say that we have a collection of DNA strings, all having the same length n. Their profile matrix is a 4Ã—n matrix P in which P1,j represents the number of times 
#     that 'A' occurs in the jth position of one of the strings, P2,j represents the number of times that C occurs in the jth position, and so on.
#     A consensus string c is a string of length n formed from our collection by taking the most common symbol at each position; the jth symbol of c therefore corresponds 
#     to the symbol having the maximum value in the j-th column of the profile matrix. Of course, there may be more than one most common symbol, leading to multiple 
#     possible consensus strings.

#     Given: A collection of at most 10 DNA strings of equal length (at most 1 kbp) in FASTA format.
#     Return: A consensus string and profile matrix for the collection. (If several possible consensus strings exist, then you may return any one of them.)

#     !!! NOTICE that the actual dataset that Rosalind gives you is in FASTA format, so it looks something more like this (need to take into account the seperated lines):
#     >Rosalind_1
#     ATCCAGCT
#     GGGCAACT
