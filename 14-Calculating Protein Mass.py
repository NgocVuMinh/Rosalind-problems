# PROBLEM
# In a weighted alphabet, every symbol is assigned a positive real number called a weight. 
# A string formed from a weighted alphabet is called a weighted string, and its weight is equal to the sum of the weights of its symbols.
# The standard weight assigned to each member of the 20-symbol amino acid alphabet is the monoisotopic mass of the corresponding amino acid.

# Given: A protein string P of length at most 1000 aa.
# Return: The total weight of P. Consult the monoisotopic mass table.

# NOTICE: 1. the monoisotopic mass table is provided my Rosalind as a string.
#         2. the dataset provided my Rosalind has an empty line at the bottom ('\n'), this needs removing.
